# What matters goes

Cold and grey  
My mind and the day.  
But at Upton Warren,  
House Martin's skim the water hollows.   
Salt long scooped bare.   
But on Cobley Hill,  
Bluebells sweep the woods.   
No one goes there.   
Wings tremble, colour shivers.   
As we hurt ourselves and each other,  
What matters, goes.
